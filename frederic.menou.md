### Near the kernel
_Home sweet home_

I love code. And I love **clean code**, which works fine and which **brings a service**.
And whatever the GUI you could develop, and there's most of a time a server under the surface.

_Scratch the surface_
This is where I can spend most of my time (on duty or spare time).

Most people get scared when you got to connect to a server over ssh (_remind me what's a public key?_).
I'm **not a pro sysadmin**, but I got **enough notions** to save my a$$ most of the times (Enter~. if you what I mean).

Did I say you how much I love **clean code**? This is very important, especially if you have to rely on this code 24h a day.
And with clean code you also need some kind of software factory. 2 years ago, I felt in love with **git**. You're on a git repository, so I won't explain it to you.

But I love this so much I spent hours and hours helping other developers to make them master it. And believe me, I know how to explain a rebase to almost any developer.
This is just a matter of Acyclic Directed Graphs manipulation.

My point is that mastering such a tool is huge step to code quality.
Git was such a revelation that inspired me an personal project, [Magrit][1]. I succeed hiring 2 others developers and since a few month I'm experiencing distributed team workflow. At some extent we try to implement what Github team call Asynchronous Development.

I'm still hoping professional could use this kind of workflow one day or another.

So I told you about clean code, but not about details. I'm a **JVM** fan. Mostly with Java, this is for sure my strongest language.

### The shell or the UI?
_Shall we make a choice?_

I do prefer the shell, that's why mostly develop on the prompt. As an example, please have a look at [Magrit][1].
This may interest you if you're using git and are very committed to continuous quality.

But my end-users rather prefer 2D UI, and that's legit.
So most of my experiences involve frontends such as Swing, GWT, and pure HTML/CSS/JS.
I can't link proofs to this, so you should test me to be sure.
